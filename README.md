# Onur

Easily manage multiple FLOSS repositories.

`Onur` grab all repositories listed in the configuration files.

# Installation

[php](https://github.com/easbarba/onur_php) | [ruby](https://github.com/easbarba/qas.rb) | [go](https://github.com/easbarba/qas_go) | [api-go](https://github.com/easbarba/qas_api_go)

## Usage

`Onur` consumes configurations files at `$XDG_CONFIG/onur`.

- `$ONUR_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable is available to define a new location of configuration files.
- repositories are stored in the `$HOME/Projects` folder.

## Configuration file

A `onur` configuration file is just a single list providing name and url of projects, branch may be provided if not the usual `master` branch:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "awesomewm",
    "url": "https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome"
  },
  {
    "name": "nuxt",
    "branch": "main",
    "url": "https://github.com/nuxt/framework"
  }
]
```

More examples of configuration files are at `examples`.

## Settings

A TOML settings file may define the behavior of `onur`:

```toml
[base]
single-branch = true
quiet = true
depth = 1
```

## Options

Consult `onur --help` for more options.

## GNU Guix

In a system with GNU Guix binary installed, its even easier to grab all
dependencies: `guix shell`.
